# HSIC_Bottleneck-Pytorch Implementation

## Description

This is a pytorch implementation of HSIC bottleneck with performance of 97~98% on MNIST using similar setting as in the original paper.
This implementation is easier to understand than the [original work](https://github.com/choasma/HSIC-bottleneck). 

Compared to [this Pytorch implementation](https://github.com/gusye1234/Pytorch-HSIC-bottleneck) (I thank the author pretty much !!), our implementation works on MNIST and we did the gradient in the right way: the HSIC bottleneck does not use back propagation, so we can only perform gradient descent for each layer's weights. So stopping gradient as ```layer(input.detach())``` is necessary.

For research interests, 
1. I wonder the difference in applying student-t distribution as kernel, so one can use  ```--kernel_x "rbf" --kernel_y "rbf"``` to specify the kernel.
2. I also curious about if dropping the HSIC($X$,$Z_i$) term or substituting it with HSIC($Z_{i-1}$,$Z_i$) yields non-inferior performance. Excitingly, the answer seems affirmative (for now XD).
